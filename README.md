### Kia ora, I'm Aisyah ðŸ‘‹

I recently completed the intensive full-immersion web development training programme at [Enspiral Dev Academy](https://devacademy.co.nz/). I enjoy honing my problem solving skills through coding - there is always something new to learn! I am excited to continue learning how to make apps user-friendly and accessible and exploring the possibilities in tech, particularly the 'tech for good' space. I see tech as a useful tool that can provide solutions to real world problems and add value to society and people's lives.
