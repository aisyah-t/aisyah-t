### Kia ora, I'm Aisyah ðŸ‘‹

I recently completed the intensive full-immersion web development training programme at [Enspiral Dev Academy](https://devacademy.co.nz/). I enjoy honing my problem solving skills through coding - there are various ways to solve coding problems and there is always something new to learn. My current strength is in front end web development and I am particularly interested in creating functional apps that are user-friendly, intuitive and accessible.
