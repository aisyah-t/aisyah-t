### Kia ora, I'm Aisyah 👋

I'm a budding web developer and lifelong learner who enjoys solving problems and creating using code. My current strength is in the front end and I believe in using technology for good.

I recently completed a front end engineer internship at [Upstock](https://upstock.app) and so the majority of my commits from October 2020 - January 2021 were for Upstock's private repository.

#### 🐱‍💻 I am currently learning:
- Python
- Test automation using [Playwright for Python](https://playwright.dev/)

#### 🌱 Up next on my list of things to learn...
- React Context API
- Gatsby and Next.js
- GraphQL
- Ruby on Rails
- TypeScript
