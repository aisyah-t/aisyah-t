### Kia ora, I'm Aisyah ðŸ‘‹

I recently completed the intensive full-immersion web development training programme at [Enspiral Dev Academy](https://devacademy.co.nz/). I enjoy honing my problem solving skills through coding - there are various ways to solve coding problems and there is always something new to learn. I am excited to continue learning how to make user-friendly and accessible apps and exploring the possibilities in tech. I am particularly interested in front-end web development and creating functional apps that are user-friendly, intuitive and accessible.
