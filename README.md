### Kia ora, I'm Aisyah 👋

I recently completed the intensive full-immersion web development training programme at [Enspiral Dev Academy](https://devacademy.co.nz/). I enjoy honing my problem solving skills through coding - there are various ways to solve coding problems and there is always something new to learn. I am excited to continue learning how to make user-friendly and accessible apps and exploring the possibilities in tech. I see tech as a useful tool that can provide solutions to real world problems and add value to society and people's lives. I am particularly interested in the "tech for good" space.
