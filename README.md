### Kia ora, I'm Aisyah ðŸ‘‹

I recently completed the intensive full-immersion web development training programme at [Enspiral Dev Academy](https://devacademy.co.nz/). I enjoy honing my coding problem solving skills and creating using code. My current strength is in the front end and I am interested in making tech tools that are user-friendly, intuitive and accessible.

I am currently doing a front end engineer internship at [Upstock] (https://upstock.app) and so the majority of my recent commits will be for Upstock.

#### ðŸŒ± Up next on my list of things to learn...
- React Hooks and Context
- TypeScript
- Gatsby and Next.js
- C# & .NET
